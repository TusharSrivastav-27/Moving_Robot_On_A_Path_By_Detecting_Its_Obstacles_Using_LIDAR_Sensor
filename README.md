# Moving_robot_on_a_path_by_detecting_its_obstacles_using_LIDAR_sensor

In this project I have made a robot which can move on it's path automatically by it's own without touching the walls of the path. It can also detect it's obstacles using LIDAR sensor and chooses other path so that it does not collide to that obstacle.
